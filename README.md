# Intro

Hi, this is my personal project. I had lots of fun making this. If you see this, I hope you get inspired from it and make your own better version. I hope you will have fun. I started this project on 2/18/23. This also happened to be the first day I started coding with Python. There are tons of wonderful brains out there who are about ten times better than me, who can only (not so well) use Python. I will continue programming, and I hope to become a programmer one day.
